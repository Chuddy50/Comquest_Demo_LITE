So, it&#x27;s no longer about collectively picking something that is genuinely new but individuals cherry-picking whatever that they like. And it helps of course that we&#x27;re not funneling media through a handful of TV channels, newspapers, etc. anymore like we used to.

          "text": "Clothing variation has a lot to do with not only <i>fashions</i> but <i>fabrics</i>. Considered over a longer timescale, up through the late 19th century, the principle options for clothing were cotton, flax, silk, wool, leather, grasses (in some regions), and metal, with very few other options. Viscose rayon was the first <i>synthetic</i> fibre created, in 1899.  It was followed by Nylon (1930s) which pressaged a slew of additional synthetics, notably polyester.  Adoption was somewhat slowed by various factors, including WWII, but by the 1960s synthetic fabrics and brilliant dyes were exploding into popularity. Flagrant use of synthetics faded somewhat through the 1970s and 1980s, with fabric blends and natural fabrics becoming more prevalent (yes, I&#x27;m aware that the leisure suit was prominent in the 1970s, but it was <i>less</i> so by the end of the decade). There&#x27;ve been variations in specific styles since, though most to my eye have been evocative of earlier 20th-century periods since the 1990s, rather than distinctively original.  (I&#x27;m far from an expert in clothing fashion, take with heaping handfuls of salt.) Other scene-setting elements include architectural styles (notably houses in the West), automobiles, and since ~2000, the presence and style of handheld mobile devices, smartphones after about 2010.  Camera styles would be a useful indicator for much of the 1900s (&quot;Brownie&quot; box cameras, SLRs, &quot;Instamatics&quot;, and the like).",

As for some (hopefully constructive) feedback: I think the year selection slider could benefit from a few adjustments. If an image is from the distant past\u2014say, pre-1950s\u2014it might make more sense to use decade-based precision rather than individual years. For example, a black-and-white photo had me way off that caused me to lose 20 years of my life :). It would be helpful if such images were categorized more broadly, something like \u201c191x\u201d. For mid-century images (roughly 1960\u20131990), a 5-year interval could strike a better balance. I came across one from that era and was six years off. And for more recent images, say post-2010, a one-year precision feels reasonable. Of course, this suggestion mainly applies if we&#x27;re deducing the year based on visual cues like clothing, hairstyles, and the environment. If the game is intended more as a quiz based on the text descriptions under the images, then it shifts more into trivia territory\u2014and that\u2019s a different type of challenge altogether.",

It was very satisfying as a user to think that the photo of all the people might be of the Egyptian revolution in 2011, then end up getting the year exactly right. Some photos are inherently gonna be easier to tell than others. Wartime photos can have a fun game of &quot;figure out which war it is based on the equipment&quot;. I think the problem with the subway photo is that it&#x27;s a very memorable situation, to use subway tunnels as shelters. But there are plenty of wartime photos that aren&#x27;t gonna be that way. I also like trying to figure out where the photo was taken, even if that isn&#x27;t strictly part of the game. So I&#x27;m glad that the photo caption is there.",
