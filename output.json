They own the ecosystem thanks to CUDA, Infiniband, NGC, NVLink, and other key tools. Now they should add additional applications (the AI Foundry is a good way to do that), or forays into adjacent spaces like white-labeled cluster management. Working on building custom designs and consulting on custom GPU projects would be helpful as well by helping monetize their existing design practice during slower markets. Of course, Nvidia is starting to do both, with Nvidia AI Foundry for the former and is working on the latter by starting a GPU architecture and design consulting as announced at GTC and under McKinney",
